Dependencies ,tools and framework Description :


React Native : React Native is a mobile app development framework created by Facebook. 
It allows developers to create native mobile apps using JavaScript and the React library.
React Native enables us to build world-class application experiences on native platforms 
using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. With React Native, 
we don't build a "mobile web app", an "HTML 5 app", or a "hybrid app". 
we can build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using 
Objective-C or Java.



Axios : React Native Axios is a library used to make HTTP requests from Node.js or React Native. It helps us handle the complexity
of making requests with the modern browser's XMLHttpRequest interface and handles basic authentication,
transforms and parsing for JSON data, supports timeouts, promises, file uploads and more.


expo cli : Expo CLI is the command line interface for managing projects created with Expo,
a platform for quickly developing cross-platform mobile applications. It provides an environment
for creating, building, and serving our project locally or on the web. With Expo CLI we can run 
our app in simulator or on physical device, publish to expo servers, and build standalone binaries (apk/ipa)



Eas build : EAS Build is an automated build system that simplifies the process of creating and
managing builds. It uses a set of pre-defined tasks and configurations to create a consistent, 
repeatable, and reliable build process. The system helps ensure that all code changes are tested 
before they get deployed into production. It also enables teams to quickly roll out new features 
without having to manually build each part of the application separately. Additionally, it can be
used to detect regressions in existing features or bugs introduced by code changes in order to reduce 
time spent debugging issues.




yarn / node package manager (npm) : Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers 
to install, manage and use packages from registries such as the npm registry. Yarn can be used to 
install packages from the npm registry or other registries such as Bower and GitHub. It also provides
features like offline installation of packages, network performance improvements, security enhancements 
and more.
       Node Package Manager (NPM) is a package manager for Node.js applications which manages dependencies
between software components and simplifies their installation process. NPM includes commands for installing, 
uninstalling, updating, configuring, publishing and managing Node modules in an application's source code repository.
It also provides various tools for discovering new modules as well as versioning them according to semantic versioning 
standards.




Firebase (DB)(only for authentication purpose) : Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides
developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop high quality apps. Firebase offers cloud storage, 
authentication, hosting, real time database synchronization, analytics and more.
          Firebase Authentication is a service provided by Firebase which allows users to create and manage accounts for
their applications. It can be used to authenticate users with existing third party identity providers such as Google, 
Facebook or Twitter. Firebase Authentication also supports custom authentication methods such as passwordless sign in or 
multi factor authentication. Additionally it provides features like Identity Verification where verifiers can check the 
identity of the user based on additional information like email address or phone number. 








############PRODUCT DESCRIPTION################

Overall Description

Product prespective :

The product is related to the crypto price charting and tracking ability with 
price calculator in-built on top of the chart which provides the real time 
gains and loss of crypto prices in realworld cryptomarket. Its is targeted for the organization
or individual who are intrested to keep track of real time crypto prices.


System Interface : 

The client system will be able to share coin data availabe from api response through the network connection.



User interface : 

The screen formats and menu layout are structured in such a way so the first time user can find it easy 
to use and adapt to the interface much faster.The product is very user friendly and interactive.


Communication interface : 

There is framework called axios is used to make communication among the different apis to be used in the system.



Memory constraints : 

As of now this product is only availabe for tge android os and is in development and improvement phase.
It can be usuable on any android device which have access to well speed internet connections and minimum
processor of snapdragon sd470 or higher.A device must also have sufficient amount of disk and memory space to 
make this product runnable.
